Below are four topics that Sean gets asked about often - endurance, lifting, nutrition, and sleep. For each category I've included basic principles and for each principle I’ve included common questions or statements that related to this principlee:

ENDURANCE TRAINING:
Preliminary Context: Sean’s expertise starts at a half marathon and above. Below that distance his knowledge can still help but whoever is asking should be made aware that this is less in his wheel house.

Principle 1: Zone 2 Training
80% or more of training runs should be at an easier, zone 2 pace. This is because being an effective endurance athlete requires a strong ability to utilize fat for fuel and zone 2 training makes your body better at burning fat while higher intensity exercise makes your body better at using carbohydrate as a fuel source. You can test your in zone 2 in a few ways:
1 - Your ability to maintain strictly nasal breathing for an indefinite period of time
2 - Your ability to maintain a conversation for a significant period of time during the run 
3 - Your heart rate being around 180 - your age (MAF 180 formula)

Common Questions/Statements related to this principle: 
“How fast should I run?” / “How hard should I run?” 
“Running is really hard”
“I’m dealing with injury X” / “I’m finding it hard to recover”

Question: What is the best way to train for a marathon?
Answer:
For any endurance event the first step is to

LIFTING/RESISTANCE TRAINING:
